## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCss - For styles

### What I learned

1. Key Learnings from Building a Recipe Page with Tailwind CSS
   Mobile-First Approach:

-  Tailwind CSS encourages a mobile-first workflow, which means designing for smaller screens first and then scaling up to larger screens. This   approach ensures better responsiveness and a smoother user experience across all devices.

2. Responsive Design Mastery:

-  Learned how to effectively manage width, height, and layout using Tailwindâ€™s responsive utility classes (e.g., md:, lg:). This helped in creating a fluid and adaptable design without relying heavily on custom CSS.

3. Customizing Tailwind:

- Explored extending Tailwindâ€™s default configuration by adding custom classes in tailwind.config.js. This allowed for reusable styles while maintaining consistency across the project.

- Also learned how to integrate custom styles via input.css for additional flexibility when needed.

4. Efficient Styling Workflow:

- Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach significantly speeds up development by reducing the need for writing repetitive CSS. This project helped me appreciate the balance between utility classes and custom CSS when necessary.

This experience strengthened my understanding of modern CSS frameworks and responsive design principles. Excited to apply these learnings to more complex projects!
